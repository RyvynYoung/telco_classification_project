# Telco Churn Classification Project

## Planning Stage
Project Description: Why are our customers churning?

GOALS:
Find drivers for customer churn.
Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
Create modules that make your process repeateable.
Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report.

Audience: Codeup Data Science Team
Setting: Virtual 5 minute walk through of Documented Jupyter Notebook
Brainstorm: key highlights, key visualizations, prototype

MVP Questions to answer
Are there clear groupings where a customer is more likely to churn?
Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn?
Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point?

## Acquire Stage
DELIVERABLES: .py file for data acquisition and notes for replicating results (note access to Codeup SQL data files is required)

## Preparation Stage
DELIVERABLES: .py file for data preparation and notes for replication

## Exploration and Pre-Processing Stage
DELIVERABLES: You are required to run at least 2 statistical tests in your data exploration. Document your hypotheses and set your alpha before running the tests and document your findings well. Summarize your conclusions, provide clear answers to the specific questions, and summarize any takeaways/action plan.

## Modeling Stage
DELIVERABLES: You are required to establish a baseline accuracy to determine if having a model is better than no model and train and compare at least 3 different models. Document these steps well.

## Delivery Stage
DELIVERABLES: Summarize your findings. Key takeaways and next steps should be documented here.
